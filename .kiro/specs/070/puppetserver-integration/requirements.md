# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for version 0.3.0 of Pabawi, which focuses on **fixing critical implementation issues** and **completing the plugin architecture migration** for all integrations. Version 0.3.0 establishes a consistent plugin-based architecture across Bolt, PuppetDB, and Puppetserver, removing legacy 0.1.0 implementation patterns where integrations were not properly abstracted.

### Critical Issues to Address

The current implementation has several critical bugs that prevent core functionality from working:

1. **Bolt Integration**: Still uses legacy 0.1.0 patterns with direct BoltService usage instead of plugin architecture
2. **Inventory View**: Does not show Puppetserver nodes
3. **Node View Issues**:
   - Puppetserver facts don't show up
   - Node status returns "node not found" for existing nodes
   - Catalog compilation shows fake "environment 1" and "environment 2"
   - Environments tab shows no environments
   - Puppet reports from PuppetDB show "0 0 0" for all values
   - Catalog from PuppetDB shows no resources
   - No view of catalog from Puppetserver (should merge catalog tabs)
4. **Events Page**: Hangs indefinitely

### Version 0.3.0 Goals

1. **Complete Plugin Migration**: Migrate Bolt to use the plugin architecture consistently with PuppetDB and Puppetserver
2. **Fix API Implementations**: Correct PuppetDB and Puppetserver API implementations that are causing data retrieval failures
3. **Fix UI Integration**: Ensure all UI components properly call backend APIs and handle responses
4. **Establish Baseline**: Create a stable, working foundation for all three integrations before adding new features

This version prioritizes **fixing existing functionality** over adding new features, establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Glossary

- **Pabawi**: A general-purpose remote execution interface that integrates multiple infrastructure management tools (Bolt, PuppetDB, Puppetserver, Ansible, etc.)
- **Puppetserver**: The Puppet server application that compiles catalogs and serves files
- **Certname**: The unique identifier for a node in Puppet, typically the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
- **Puppet Environment**: A isolated branch of Puppet code that can be deployed and tested independently
- **Catalog Compilation**: The process of generating a node-specific catalog from Puppet code for a given environment
- **Node Status**: Information about a node's last Puppet run, including timestamp, success/failure, and catalog version
- **Inventory Source**: A system or service that provides a list of nodes available for remote execution operations
- **Information Source**: A backend system that provides node data (PuppetDB, Puppetserver, cloud APIs, etc.)
- **Node Linking**: The process of associating nodes from different sources based on matching identifiers (e.g., hostname/certname)
- **Integration Plugin**: A modular component that connects Pabawi to an external system following the established plugin architecture

## Requirements

## Summary

Version 0.3.0 focuses on **fixing critical bugs** rather than adding new features. The primary goals are:

1. **Complete Plugin Architecture**: Migrate Bolt to use the plugin system consistently
2. **Fix API Implementations**: Correct all PuppetDB and Puppetserver API calls
3. **Fix UI Integration**: Ensure UI components properly call and handle backend responses
4. **Improve Observability**: Add comprehensive logging for debugging

Once these issues are resolved, version 0.3.0 will provide a stable foundation with three working integrations: Bolt, PuppetDB, and Puppetserver.

# Unified Logging System - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A comprehensive frontend + backend logging system with deep expert mode integration for full-stack debugging.

## Components Created

### 1. Frontend Logger Service

**File:** `frontend/src/lib/logger.svelte.ts`

- Structured logging (debug, info, warn, error)
- Automatic sensitive data obfuscation (passwords, tokens, API keys, etc.)
- Circular buffer (100 entries max)
- Throttled backend sync (1 request/second)
- Correlation ID support
- Auto-syncs with expert mode state
- localStorage persistence

### 2. Backend Debug Routes

**File:** `backend/src/routes/debug.ts`

- POST `/api/debug/frontend-logs` - Receive frontend log batches
- GET `/api/debug/frontend-logs/:correlationId` - Retrieve logs
- GET `/api/debug/frontend-logs` - List all correlation IDs
- DELETE endpoints for cleanup
- In-memory storage with automatic cleanup (5 min TTL, 100 ID max)

### 3. Enhanced API Client

**File:** `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`

- Generates correlation IDs for each request
- Logs all API operations (requests, responses, errors, retries)
- Sends correlation ID and expert mode headers
- Captures performance timing

### 4. Enhanced Expert Mode Service

**File:** `backend/src/services/ExpertModeService.ts`

- New `FrontendLogEntry` interface
- `addFrontendLogs()` method
- Frontend logs included in `_debug` responses

### 5. Enhanced Middleware

**File:** `backend/src/middleware/expertMode.ts`

- Extracts `X-Correlation-ID` header
- Stores in `req.correlationId`
- Available to all route handlers

### 6. Server Integration

**File:** `backend/src/server.ts`

- Debug router mounted at `/api/debug`
- Integrated into middleware chain

## Key Features

### Security

✅ Automatic sensitive data obfuscation  
✅ In-memory only storage (no database persistence)  
✅ Automatic cleanup (5 min TTL)  
✅ Only sends logs when expert mode enabled  

### Performance

✅ Throttled backend sync (1 req/sec max)  
✅ Circular buffer prevents memory growth  
✅ No impact when expert mode disabled  
✅ Logs flushed on page unload  

### Developer Experience

✅ Unified logging API across frontend/backend  
✅ Correlation IDs link frontend actions to backend processing  
✅ Full request lifecycle visibility  
✅ Easy to use in components and routes  

## Data Flow

```
User Action → Frontend Logger → Circular Buffer
                    ↓
              (if expert mode)
                    ↓
         Throttled Backend Sync
                    ↓
         Backend Debug Endpoint
                    ↓
         In-Memory Storage (by correlation ID)
                    ↓
         Included in Expert Mode Responses
                    ↓
         Timeline View in UI
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete (This Session)

- ✅ Frontend logger service
- ✅ Backend debug endpoint
- ✅ API integration
- ✅ Expert mode enhancement
- ✅ Middleware updates
- ✅ Server integration

### Phase 2: UI Enhancement (Next)

- ⏳ Update `ExpertModeDebugPanel` with timeline view
- ⏳ Add filtering by log level
- ⏳ Add search functionality
- ⏳ Enhanced copy functionality with full context

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation

- ⏳ End-to-end testing
- ⏳ Performance testing
- ⏳ Update user documentation
- ⏳ Add examples to developer guide

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Component

```typescript
import { logger } from '../lib/logger.svelte';

logger.info('TaskRunInterface', 'runTask', 'Starting task', {
  taskName: 'service::restart',
  targets: ['web01', 'web02']
});
```

### Backend Route

```typescript
import { getFrontendLogs } from "../routes/debug";

if (req.expertMode && req.correlationId) {
  const frontendLogs = getFrontendLogs(req.correlationId);
  expertModeService.addFrontendLogs(debugInfo, frontendLogs);
}
```

## Benefits

**For Debugging:**

- See exactly what happened from user click to backend response
- Identify performance bottlenecks (frontend vs backend)
- Full error context with stack traces

**For Support:**

- Users can copy complete debug info for tickets
- Reproducible issues with full state snapshot
- No screen sharing needed for basic debugging

**For Development:**

- Consistent logging pattern across stack
- Easy to add logging to new features
- Automatic sensitive data protection

## Configuration

All configuration stored in localStorage:

**Logger Config:** `pabawi_logger_config`

```json
{
  "logLevel": "info",
  "sendToBackend": false,
  "bufferSize": 100,
  "includePerformance": true,
  "throttleMs": 1000
}
```

**Expert Mode:** `pabawi_expert_mode`

```json
{
  "enabled": false
}
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Created

- `frontend/src/lib/logger.svelte.ts` (new)
- `backend/src/routes/debug.ts` (new)
- `.kiro/specs/pabawi-v0.5.0-release/unified-logging-implementation.md` (new)
- `.kiro/specs/pabawi-v0.5.0-release/logging-integration-summary.md` (new)

### Modified

- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` (enhanced with logging & correlation IDs)
- `backend/src/services/ExpertModeService.ts` (added frontend log support)
- `backend/src/middleware/expertMode.ts` (added correlation ID extraction)
- `backend/src/server.ts` (integrated debug router)
- `.kiro/specs/pabawi-v0.5.0-release/logging-expert-mode-pattern.md` (updated pattern)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why In-Memory Storage?

- Fast access
- No database bloat
- Auto-cleanup on restart
- Sufficient for debugging (5 min window)

### Why Throttling?

- Prevents overwhelming backend
- Batches logs efficiently
- Minimal network overhead
- No impact on user experience

### Why Correlation IDs?

- Links frontend actions to backend processing
- Enables timeline view
- Supports distributed tracing patterns
- Future-proof for microservices

### Why Obfuscation?

- Prevents accidental credential leaks
- Safe to copy/paste debug info
- Complies with security best practices
- Automatic (no developer action needed)

## Conclusion

We've successfully implemented a unified logging system that:

- Spans frontend and backend
- Integrates deeply with expert mode
- Protects sensitive data automatically
- Provides full request lifecycle visibility
- Has minimal performance impact
- Is easy to use and extend

The foundation is complete. Next step is enhancing the UI to display the timeline view and make the debugging experience even better.
